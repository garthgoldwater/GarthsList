# Garthslist
## A Rails app for online classifieds

### Summary

Garthslist is a humorous take on the popular online classifieds site, craigslist. This was a team project built by Phil Gutowski and Garth Goldwater. While building this app, we learned a lot about effective task management and more complex version control with git. We used a trello board to breakdown the project into manageable chunks. We also learned how to rebase in git and use pull requests on github as a useful tool for code review and refactoring.
